The fast increase in observational data seen in the last decade with the introduction of new and improved astronomical observational facilities requires new approaches to the exploration of acquired data. The old mentally of exact and painstaking analysis of individual objects had to be changed in order to grasp the full potential of large observational sets. On the other hand, large amounts of data and complex observational scenarios also lead to more complicated data reduction and analysis pipelines. As it is impossible to look through all acquired data and consider all variables, many computer algorithms have over the years been developed to help with those tasks. Of them, the most trending and occasionally misused are numerous machine learning procedures of classification, clustering, and regression.

In this thesis, we used some of the available machine learning tools to explore large astronomical datasets, mainly collected as part of the \Gh\ and \G\ large sky surveys. The data of those surveys were, when needed, supplemented with results of other spectroscopic and photometric surveys. This merger gave us additional information by observing a broader wavelength range and an increase in temporal coverage of variabilities by combing similar data sets.

The body of this thesis focuses on exploring different types of stars. Usually, the stars are generally separated into two broad groups: normal and peculiar. The first term describes the majority of the stars that are happily living through the longest period of their lifetime. Being non-problematic, they are easily modelled and preferred for chemical analyses such as our exploration of open stellar clusters and their surrounding. During the analysis, we explored the possibility of chemical differentiation between chemical signatures of cluster members, possible past members and surrounding stars. Separation into given components for 11 open clusters was based on kinematic vectors defined by \G\ observations. The \Gh\ survey supplied the chemical signature for a subset of stars. The analysis of open clusters in our dataset showed that they are not chemically as homogeneous as theory says and as much as we would like. Not knowing the origin of this discrepancy, we shifted to the differential chemical analysis that takes out the identified trends and compares only chemical signatures of stars with the same stellar parameters, most commonly effective temperature. The results show that uncertainties of the determined abundances and their scatter limit chemical separability between an open cluster and field stars as the majority have very comparable signatures. We showed that inclusion of kinematic information helps with the delineation as it was more likely that potentially ejected stars were chemically tagged to the cluster than remaining field stars.

The second large groups of stars that are not wanted in the above-described analyses are peculiar stars. The term is inclusive and depends on the scientific question in hand and observed wavelength region. In our case, the definition includes spectroscopically detectable classes such as interacting stars, multiple stellar systems, stars in temporally short-lived evolutionary stages and spectra with unexpected chemical compositions. Our selection of all peculiar classes depended on the comparison between normal-looking spectra and observed spectra. The modelling of normal spectra was done in multiple different ways: by averaging spectra with similar parameters, running observed spectra trough a neural network autoencoder and modelling using spectrum generative approach \TC. The direct comparison gave us a difference between expectations and reality. When we were looking at the specific wavelength regions, we uncovered spectra with pronounced molecular absorption bands of C$_2$ - stars that are carbon-rich and spectra with expressed hydrogen, [NII], and [SII] emission lines.

All tabulated results presented in this thesis are also published as freely available catalogues on the astronomical online database collection VizieR and directly from the publishers' website. The compiled catalogues could serve as a starting point for many additional research that deals with the exact physics behind identified peculiar stars and their spectra. Some of the possibilities for future studies were already given in the text and will be considered as potential observing possibilities at the available observing facilities, such as Asiago observatory where we are conducting spectroscopic observations almost every month. Most often, spectroscopic data must be complemented with photometric sets to explore or confirm additional possible physical scenarios behind interesting objects.

The hype of the big data era in astronomy is still to increase as many new telescopes and instruments are currently under development and construction. Their observations are planned to start in the following years. Until then, the \G\ satellite is continuously scanning our sky in order to bring us the most precise distances and movements for billions of stars that we are all warning for. The next grander data release is still at least a year away, but everyone is already questioning how much more can it do for science in the field of galactic archaeology. In our case, the updated distances could completely change the membership, shape and structure of open clusters and reclassify exciting possible triple stars to dull single free-floating stars because of their parallactic uncertainty. Until then, we have to double-check our applied quality filters and trust in the data and parameters currently disposable at our hands.
