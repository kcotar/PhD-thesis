This chapter has been partially adapted from the published paper titled \textit{The GALAH survey: unresolved triple Sun-like stars discovered by the \G\ mission} \cite{2019MNRAS.487.2474C} whose first author is author of this Doctoral thesis. The used computer code is published on GitHub platform  \footnote{\url{https://github.com/kcotar/GALAH-survey-Solar-like-triple-stars} and \url{https://github.com/kcotar/Solar-spectral-siblings}} and results of the analysis as a catalogue on the VizieR service  \footnote{\url{http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/MNRAS/487/2474}}.

So far, we dealt with spectral peculiarities that are directly observable from the spectra. In the case of multiple stellar systems, that might not always be true. As all of the stars in a multiple system contribute to light received by the observer, the object must be treated as multiple to determine physical properties and abundances of individual components properly. However, to get an indication that an object must be treated as multiple, a single spectrum might not be enough as it does not reveal the dynamics of the components. In this chapter, we show a possible way to identify and characterise multiple objects using data-driven machine learning approaches. We first focused on solar twin stars whose importance is given in Section \ref{sec:intro_solar} and their selection from \Gh\ spectra described in Section \ref{sec:05_selection}. Their homogeneity of chemical composition is presented in Section \ref{sec:05_chem_compos}. As some of the sources seem to be too bright to consist of only one star, their photometric and spectroscopic signature was further analysed using single star models explained in Section \ref{sec:models_all}. Modelling revealed that some of the stars in our selection could consist of two or more very similar stars, whose orbital and physical properties are summarised in Section \ref{sec:concl}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro_solar}
The Sun, being the closest and most analysed star, is widely used as a reference for the calibration of many fundamental stellar astronomical parameters \cite{2010A&A...522A..98M, 2012MNRAS.426..484D}. This usage implies a desire to find and catalogue as many stars similar to the Sun as possible. They can be used for self-calibration of observations done with the same setup or inter-calibration of multiple surveys that share observations of the same objects. Stars resembling the Sun in all physical parameters such as luminosity, mass, radius, rotation period, and chemical composition should also have an identical spectrum to our Sun. The definition of such stars, also known as solar twins, was first introduced by \citet{1981A&A....94....1C}. However, the definition is not fixed as it follows the evolution of astronomical instrumentation, observational techniques \cite{2017AN....338..442A}, and precision of determining stellar parameters and chemical abundances.

Before the release of \G\ parallaxes, one of the approaches to determine distances of twin stars or its hosting stellar cluster was based on the assumption that solar twins should have the same intrinsic luminosity as the Sun. Therefore its extinction corrected apparent brightness on the sky is directly related to their distance \cite{2015MNRAS.453.1428J, 2016A&A...595A..59M, 2017MNRAS.472.2517J}.

Another widely debated topic is the chemical composition of the Sun and its evolution in time. \citet{2009A&A...508L..17R} and \citet{2015A&A...579A..52N} addressed the question whether the composition of the Sun is peculiar when compared to other solar twins. Works like these benefit from using spectra with high signal to noise ratio and very high spectral resolution that are especially needed when trying to disentangle if the observed solar chemical composition is a consequence of the planetary system formation \cite{2014A&A...572A..48R} or intrinsic galactic chemical composition during the formation of the Sun \cite{2015A&A...579A..52N, 2016A&A...593A..65N, 2020A&A...633L...9J}. However, even the best solar twin candidate (currently thought to be the star 18 Sco \cite{2014ApJ...791...14M}), when observed with the highest possible precision, still shows minute differences in the abundance pattern which will make it even harder to disentangle the place where the Sun and its siblings were formed. At the same time, this unique chemical composition will make it easier to be confident about discovering a real solar sibling when we find one. Among the siblings, we count all stars that were formed at the same time and from the same molecular cloud as Sun, which implies that they can have the same chemical composition (see Section \ref{sec:open_clustesr_tagging}).

% With the increasing number of large all sky surveys, searches for the closest solar twin have been performed on numerous on-going and archival data sets. 

\section{Selection of the best solar-like spectra}
\label{sec:05_selection}
Our search for spectra that best resemble spectrum of the Sun uses data acquired by the expanded GALAH survey that combines multiple surveys acquired by the same telescope and spectrograph (see Section \ref{sec:galah_data} for their list). The search is based on the direct comparison between acquired stellar spectra and the reference solar spectrum, where both were observed with the same setup of the HERMES spectrograph.

\subsection{Reference solar spectrum}
\label{sec:05_reference}
Before finding the best solar-like spectra in our data set, the reference spectrum had to be constructed. For its construction, we identified $3708$ twilight flats with the SNR per resolution element in the green HERMES arm greater than 210. Observing the sky at twilight enables us to observe the solar spectrum by every fibre of the spectrograph simultaneously. This is true even if our intuition says that the colour of the sky is, because of the scattering in the atmosphere, different than during daytime. The atmospheric effect does not affect our analysis as scattering only modifies the distribution of spectral strength and does not alter relative strengths of absorption lines.

The acquired flux of selected twilight spectra was first normalised using the $7^\text{th}$ degree Chebyshev polynomial with an asymmetric sigma clipping ($2\sigma$ low and $3\sigma$ high threshold) that was run for $11$ steps. Normalisation procedure was tailored explicitly for solar-like objects as it excluded wavelength ranges with wide absorption features and regions with no near-continuum levels that were determined from the high-resolution spectrum of the Sun created by \citet{2005MSAIS...8..189K}. Especially problematic for the normalisation process is the blue arm that is packed with blended absorption lines, topped by the H$\beta$ line. Because of high SNR and presence of additional "wiggles" in observed twilight flats, we used a higher degree of polynomial function than in the case of a stellar spectrum normalisation (see Section \ref{sec:05_preprocessing}). Source of identified features that make spectrum to look wiggly is not known and might be contributed by a reflection in optics when observing bright targets or by a residual background flux that was not properly removed by the GALAH reduction pipeline \cite{2017MNRAS.464.1259K}.

The \say{radial velocity} of normalised twilight spectra was determined by correlating an observed spectrum with the high-resolution solar spectrum \cite{2005MSAIS...8..189K}. The peak of the resulting correlation function was determined by fitting a Gaussian function to it. Before correlation, the high-resolution solar spectrum was convolved with a Gaussian kernel to match its resolving power with the HERMES spectrograph and to appear as close as an observed spectra as visually possible. 

Normalised rest-frame twilight spectra were then median stacked to generate the final reference solar spectrum. Before it could be used, it was analysed for possible residual flux offsets that are impossible to remove by the reduction pipeline as we can not acquire a background spectrum at the same time as a twilight spectrum. Any residual flux would render too shallow absorption lines in the median reference solar spectrum. To equalise strengths of absorption lines in our reference solar spectrum and the high-resolution one, a small linearly changing offset was subtracted from the normalised spectrum that was re-normalised after subtraction. 

\subsection{Stellar spectra preprocessing}
\label{sec:05_preprocessing}
Preprocessing of observed stellar spectra began with combined and fluxed spectra that were prepared by the pipeline as an intermediate reduction result. First they were normalised using a $5^\text{th}$ degree Chebyshev polynomial and asymmetric sigma clipping (with $2\sigma$ low and $3\sigma$ high thresholds) that was run for $15$ steps. To determine the level of a continuum as accurately as possible, we masked spectral ranges without near-continuum pixels (H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$) during the normalisation process. Normalised spectra were then shifted for the barycentric and radial velocity that was determined by the GALAH pipeline and linearly resampled to the same wavelength step as used by the generated reference solar spectrum. Performing both steps (radial velocity shift and resampling) at the same time retains a quality of the spectrum and reduces the required number of resampling steps compared to using already shifted and normalised spectra prepared by the reduction pipeline.

\subsection{Candidate selection}
\label{sec:05_candidates}
As the number of \Gh\ spectra in our set is quite large (more than $600,000$) and some of them have entirely different spectrum than the Sun (e.g. hot stars, metal-poor giants, cool stars), we performed an initial selection of possible solar twins based purely on stellar parameters. They were determined by \TC\ interpolation pipeline \cite{buder2018}, that was part of the GALAH data release 2. For this, we first had to determine the possible offset of our interpolated parameters towards the parameters of well known solar-like benchmark stars \cite{2014A&A...564A.133J, 2015A&A...582A..49H} and the Sun. Table \ref{tab:params_twins} gives reference values of physical parameters for the Sun alongside median parameters of selected twilight flats and their standard deviations. 

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Stellar physical parameters of reference objects used to determine possible offsets between published benchmark values and values determined by \TC. For every object, the first line in table gives reference values and the second line of parameters is determined from the GALAH spectra.}
	\label{tab:params_twins}
	\begin{tabular}{r c c c}
		\hline
		Object & \Teff\ [K] & \Logg\ [dex] & \Feh\ [dex] \\ 
		\hline \hline
		Sun & $5771$ & $4.44$ & $0.02$ \\ 
		Twilight flats & $5605 \pm 40$ & $4.21 \pm 0.06$ & $-0.14 \pm 0.03$ \\ 
		\hline
		18 Sco & $5810 \pm 80$ & $4.44 \pm 0.03$ & $0.03 \pm 0.01$ \\
		& $5750 \pm 20 $ & $4.37 \pm 0.1$ & $ 0.05 \pm 0.02$ \\ 
		\hline
		$\beta$ Hyi & $5873 \pm 45$ & $3.98 \pm 0.02$ & $-0.04 \pm 0.01$ \\
		& $5784 \pm 5$ & $3.93 \pm 0.01$ & $-0.11 \pm 0.01$ \\ 
		\hline
		$\mu$ Ara & $5902 \pm 66$ & $4.3 \pm 0.03$ & $0.35 \pm 0.01$ \\
		& $5657 \pm 20$ & $4.15 \pm 0.01$ & $0.28 \pm 0.01$ \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:params_twins} also shows parameters for three benchmark stars with solar-like properties that were observed and reduced as any other object in our data set. Parameter values in the first line were taken from the published set of \G\ FGK benchmark stars \cite{2014A&A...564A.133J, 2015A&A...582A..49H} and the second line gives \TC\ parameters for the same object. From the comparison, it is evident that twilight flats have slightly more under-estimated parameters as apposed to other stars used in the comparison. \TC\ trend of stellar parameters being a bit too low is observable for all stars. Parameters are given in Table \ref{tab:params_twins}. Taking this into consideration, we initially selected stars within a broader range of \Teff~$\pm 250 $~K, \Logg~$\pm 0.4$~dex and \Feh~$\pm 0.3 $~dex around median parameters of twilight flats. Applying parameter cuts to our data set, we were left with $92,284$ spectra that were analysed further.

\subsection{Spectral similarity}
\label{sec:spec_comp_twins}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{sim_combine_b2.png}
	\caption{Correlation between the Canberra similarity metric and four other similarity metrics for the objects considered in the rough spectral comparison step.}
	\label{fig:sim_combine_twins}
\end{figure}

The similarity between observed spectra and generated reference solar spectrum was calculated using multiple distance metrics, where identical spectra are described by the similarity value of 0. Figure \ref{fig:sim_combine_twins} shows that all considered similarity metric values are strongly correlated with only few outliers. Some degree of the correlation was expected as all of the shown metrics are based on differently weighted per pixel difference between two spectra. For all the following comparisons we choose to use the Canberra distance metric \cite{Lance1967MixedDataCP} that is less sensitive to large, unnatural outlying flux values than the Euclidean distance and is defined as 
\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:equ_canberra}
	d_{Canberra}(f_{\odot}, f_{obs}) = \sum_{\lambda}^{\ } \frac{|f_{\odot,\lambda} - f_{obs,\lambda}|}{|f_{\odot,\lambda}| + |f_{obs,\lambda}|},
\end{equation}
where $f_{\odot}$ is the flux at a reference solar spectrum, $f_{obs}$ an observed spectrum and $\lambda$ wavelength bins of both spectra. Similarity value determined by the given function heavily depends on the SNR of the evaluated spectrum, which effectively degrades its spectral similarity at lower SNR values. The dependency was analysed by computing the same similarity metric between the original reference solar spectrum and noisy reference that was generated by adding Gaussian noise to the original spectrum to represent spectra with different SNR values. To determine the uncertainty of similarities, the test was repeated 1500 times for every noise level. Smooth dependence between SNR and similarity metric can be described by the following composite of linear and a power-law function defined as
\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:sim_twins}
	sim(SNR) = A \Big(\frac{SNR-SNR_{off}}{SNR_0}\Big)^{-\alpha} + B (SNR-SNR_{off}) + C,
\end{equation}
that was fitted to the resulting simulated points shown in Figure \ref{fig:similarity_snr_twins}. Parameters $A$, $B$, $C$, $SNR_0$, $SNR_{off}$, and $\alpha$ in Equation \ref{equ:sim_twins} are free and were fitted to the simulated similarity measurements at different SNR levels.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{canberra_b2_flux0_05.png}
	\caption{Equation \ref{equ:sim_twins} fitted to the simulated data points describing a relation between the spectral SNR and Canberra distance of a noisy solar spectrum in comparison with the original noise-free spectrum of the Sun.}
	\label{fig:similarity_snr_twins}
\end{figure}

We used the above relation between similarity distance and SNR (Equation \ref{equ:equ_canberra}) to compare observed spectra along with the following ranges of HERMES spectrum: 4725~-~4895~\AA\ in the blue arm, 5665~-~5865~\AA\ in the green arm, 6485~-~6725~\AA\ in the red arm, and 7700~-~7875~\AA\ in the near-infrared spectral arm. Selected ranges have non-zero flux values for all observed spectra. They do not pose any limitations on the number of usable spectra that might have undefined flux values at the range borders because of large radial velocities. The similarity between the reference and the observed spectra was not computed for the whole spectral range specified above, but was limited to known and isolated (not blended) spectral absorption lines, representing multiple different chemical elements. Number of lines per element is given in Table \ref{tab:elements_list} and is the same as used by \TC\ abundance determination procedure described in \citet{buder2018}. Around the central wavelength of each absorption line, wavelength bins around $0.5$~\AA\ wide are considered for the comparison. The bin size differs for every line and is not necessarily centred on a given line centre \cite{buder2018} to reduce the possibility of contamination by nearby lines.

\subsubsection{Best candidates}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{canberra_b3_07_envelope.png}
	\caption{Equation \ref{equ:sim_twins} was fitted to the thresholding values, denoted with red downwards arrows, that delineated 7\% of the most similar spectra in every narrow SNR bin. The resulting fit on the thresholding values is represented by the blue dashed line. Shown plot is made for the red spectral arm.}
	\label{fig:envelope_fit_twins}
\end{figure}

The spectral comparison described in Section \ref{sec:spec_comp_twins} was independently computed for every HERMES arm. With four similarity values per spectrum, we selected the set of best matching spectra in the following way. Because the similarity value heavily depends on the SNR value of a spectrum, we first determined thresholding similarity values for the best 7~\% of spectra in each narrow SNR bin. The thresholds are in Figure \ref{fig:envelope_fit_twins} visualized as red downward arrows. Width of the SNR bins was set to $4$ units and separation between them to $2$ units. After fitting the function described by Equation \ref{equ:sim_twins} to those thresholds, the best matching spectra were determined to be all spectra whose spectral similarity fell below the fitted line. By combining all four bands, we determined $329$ objects whose spectral similarities fell bellow the fitted thresholding line in all four HERMES bands. Considering every spectral arm individually, we effectively removed objects with possible reduction problems in any of them. Portion of the best solar twin spectra are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selection_step1_twins}.

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{selection_step1.png}

\end{figure}

\section{Physical properties and chemical composition of our candidates}
\label{sec:05_chem_compos}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{solar_twins_like_07_ebv_c3.png}
	\caption{Distribution of physical parameters \protect\cite{buder2020} for discovered solar twin candidates. Values above the plots represent the difference between median of the distribution (solid vertical line) and actual solar values (dashed vertical line).}
	\label{fig:twins_stats}
\end{figure}

By selecting very similar spectra, we would also expect them to have very similar abundances and parameters to solar values. Distribution of their physical parameters and abundances are shown in Figures \ref{fig:twins_stats} and \ref{fig:abund_candidates}. In general, physical parameters have a slight offset from the published solar values. The most obvious difference is the distribution of \Logg\ for solar twins in the middle panel of Figure \ref{fig:twins_stats}. The tail towards lower \Logg\ values suggests existence of stars with different radii. Those stars are exciting and will be analysed in the following sections.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{abund_all_selection_ebv_c3.png}
	\caption{Normalised distributions of the measured abundance values determined during production of the third \Gh\ data release \protect\cite{buder2020}. Plotted are abundances values for our complete set of solar twin candidates. Median values and one standard deviations are in plots marked by strong and transparent red vertical lines respectively. Values on the left, under element name, represent number of used abundance values for the construction of histogram and deviation of its median value from the zero abundance value that should represent solar abundance level. The solar abundance calibration and offset determination are thoroughly explained by \protect\citet{buder2020}.}
	\label{fig:abund_candidates}
\end{figure}

Even more interesting, especially for the purpose of chemical tagging experiments, are the distributions of abundances in Figure \ref{fig:abund_candidates}. From the shown median values, we can determine possible offset with stellar abundances and abundances determined by other large surveys. For the well-behaved elements, that are not marked with a * in Table \ref{tab:elements_list}, the median values are within $0.1$~dex of solar values. A bit more worrying in their standard deviation that can be as large as $\sim0.2$~dex - something that we do not want when searching for almost identical stellar spectra. Elements marked as problematic in Table \ref{tab:elements_list} are as expected having a very low number or even no abundance measurements.

\section{Absolute magnitudes of solar twin candidates}
\label{sec:abs_mag_triple}
The latest \G\ data release enables us to accurately determine absolute magnitudes for a large fraction of its stars. Given the fact that all our solar-like stars have similar spectra, we expected their absolute magnitudes to be almost the same. When we plotted their apparent magnitudes against their measured parallaxes, shown in Figure \ref{fig:par_gmean}, it became evident that this assumption does not hold for all stars in our set. A fraction of them appeared to be over-luminous and could be unresolved stellar multiple systems with two or more near-identical stars. As the multiplicity is not uncommon among solar-type stars (see Section \ref{sec:multiplicity_intro_twins}), we used additional photometric data (presented in Section \ref{sec:data_triples}) to develop a data-driven model (see Section \ref{sec:models_all}) that was used to model observed spectrum and absolute magnitudes of our solar twin candidates.

\section{Solar-type stars and their multiplicity}
\label{sec:multiplicity_intro_twins}
The investigation of solar-type stars in the solar neighbourhood has revealed that around half of them are found in binary or more complex stellar systems \cite{2010ApJS..190....1R, 2013ARA&A..51..269D, 2017ApJS..230...15M}. Of all multiple systems, about 13~\% are part of higher-order hierarchical systems \cite{2010ApJS..190....1R, 2014AJ....147...87T}. Beyond the solar neighbourhood, the angular separation between members of such multiple systems becomes too small for their components to be spatially resolvable in the sky. Spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric surveys observe those sources as single light points. It has been suggested that the population of binaries in the field could be even higher than in the solar neighbourhood \cite{2000A&A...361..770Q}. Therefore a combination of multiple complementary approaches must be used to detect and analyse multiple stellar systems with different properties \cite{2017ApJS..230...15M}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{mag_parallax_gaia_ebv_c3_07.png}
	\caption{Parallax versus measured apparent \G\ G magnitude for our solar twin candidates. Stars marked with black crosses have significant re-normalised astrometric uncertainties (RUWE~>~$1.4$) which may lead to wrongly determined distance and consequently their absolute magnitude. The dashed line represents an absolute theoretical magnitude of the Sun G~=~$4.68$ as it would be observed at different parallaxes. The solar absolute magnitude was computed from the relations given by \citet{2018arXiv180409368E}. Similarly, the relations for a binary and a triple system composed of multiple solar twins are plotted with the dash-dotted and dotted line.}
	\label{fig:par_gmean}
\end{figure}

If the orbital period of such a system is relatively short, with high orbital velocities, it can be spectroscopically identified as a multiple system in two ways. When the components are of comparable luminosities, the effect of multiple absorption lines can be observed in the system's spectrum. Such an object is also known as a double-lined binary (SB2) system \cite{2004A&A...424..727P, 2010AJ....140..184M, 2017PASP..129h4201F, 2017A&A...608A..95M}. By contrast, a single-lined binary (SB1) system does not show the same effect, as the secondary component is too faint to contribute significant flux. Short period SB1 systems can be identified from the periodic radial velocity variations if multi-epoch spectroscopy is available \cite{1991A&A...248..485D, 2004A&A...418..989N, 2011AJ....141..200M, 2016AJ....151...85T, 2018ApJ...854..147B}. Other extrema are very wide binaries \cite{1988ApJ...335L..47G, 1990AJ....100.1968C, 1995ApJ...441..200G, 2009ApJ...703.1511K, 2011ApJS..192....2S, 2017MNRAS.472..675A, 2018MNRAS.480.4302C}, and co-moving pairs \cite{2017AJ....153..257O, 2019AJ....157...78J} that can only be identified by their spatial proximity and common velocity vector.

\citet{2013ARA&A..51..269D} summarized that the majority of Solar-type stars are part of binary systems with periods of hundreds to thousands of years, whose period distribution reaches a maximum at $\log(P)\approx5$, for $P$ measured in days. Because of the wide separation and long orbital periods of the components in such a scenario, the radial velocity variations will have both low amplitude and long period. This long periodicity makes them challenging to detect in large-scale spectroscopic surveys, which typically last for less than a decade, and have a low number of revisits. A spectrum of such a binary or triple still contains a spectroscopic signature of all members, and those contributions can be disentangled into individual components \cite{2018MNRAS.473.5043E, 2018MNRAS.476..528E}. Such a decomposition is easier when a binary consists of spectrally different stars \cite{2005A&A...440..995S, 2007MNRAS.382.1377R, 2012MNRAS.419..806R, 2013AJ....146...82R, 2016MNRAS.458.3808R}. However, it becomes much harder or near-impossible when the composite spectrum consists of contribution from near-identical stars whose individual radial velocities are almost identical \cite{2015IJAsB..14..173B}. In that case, additional photometric and distance measurement have to be used to constrain possible combinations \cite{2018ApJ...857..114W}. If spectroscopic data are not available, determination of multiples can be attempted purely based on photometric information \cite{1997A&A...327..598F, 1998MNRAS.300..977H, 2016MNRAS.455.3009M, 2018ApJ...857..114W}, but such approaches are limited to certain stellar types, and yield results that might be polluted with young pre-main-sequence stars \cite{2018arXiv181010435Z}.

\section{Additional photometric data}
\label{sec:data_triples}
%% APASS, WISE, 2MASS
Photometric magnitudes provided by the \G\ DR2 release \cite{2016A&A...595A...1G, 2018A&A...616A...1G} as shown in Figure \ref{fig:par_gmean} for our set of solar twins cover only a small wavelength region of the light produced by those stars. For a broader wavelength coverage, additional photometric data were taken from three large all-sky surveys. In the visual part of the spectrum we rely on the AAVSO Photometric All-Sky Survey (APASS, \cite{2015AAS...22533616H}) B, V, g', r', i' bands that are supplemented by the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS, \cite{2006AJ....131.1163S}) J, H, K$_S$ bands, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE, \cite{2010AJ....140.1868W}) W1, W2 bands. All of those surveys were cross-matched with the GALAH targets, which resulted in up to 13 photometric observations per star. Photometric values and their uncertainties were taken as published in these catalogues, ignoring any specific quality flags. During the initial investigation of their usefulness, WISE W3, and W4 bands proved to be unreliable for our application and were therefore removed from further use. The main reason for their removal is a large scatter in magnitude measurements of similar stars and a substantial overlap between single and multiple stars evident in Figure \ref{fig:viol_photometry}.

\section{Solar-like spectra}

\subsection{Candidate multiple systems}
\label{sec:multi_cand}
Among the solar twin candidates, we noticed a photometric trend that is inconsistent with the distance of an object that resembles the Sun. Solar twins, mimicking the observed solar spectrum, should also be similar to it in all other observables such as luminosity, effective temperature, surface gravity, chemical composition and absolute magnitude. Plotting their apparent magnitude against \G\ parallax measurement (Figure \ref{fig:par_gmean}), all of the detected stars should lie near or on the theoretical line, describing the same relation for the Sun observed at different parallaxes. As the magnitude of the Sun is not directly measured by the \G\ or determined by the \G\ team, we computed its absolute magnitude using the relations published by \citet{2018arXiv180409368E} that connect the \G\ photometric system with other photometric systems. The reference solar magnitudes (in multiple filters) that were used in the computation were taken from \citet{2018ApJS..236...47W}. The resulting absolute G magnitude of the Sun is $4.68 \pm 0.02$, where the uncertainty comes from the use of multiple relations. This value also coincides with the synthetic \G\ photometry produced by \citet{2018MNRAS.479L.102C}, who determined absolute magnitude of the Sun to be M$_{G, \odot} = 4.67$.

Within our sample of the probable solar twins, we identified $64$ stars that show signs of being too bright at a given parallax. In Figure \ref{fig:par_gmean} they are noticeable as a sequence of data points that lie below the theoretical line and are parallel to it. Another even more obvious indication of their excess luminosity is given by the colour-magnitude diagram in Figure \ref{fig:gabs_colour} where the same group of stars is brighter by $\sim0.7$ magnitude. As both groups of stars are visually separable, the multiple stellar candidates can easily be isolated by selecting objects with extinction corrected absolute G magnitude above the binary limit line shown in Figure \ref{fig:gabs_colour}. To compute the absolute magnitudes, we used the distance to stars inferred by the Bayesian approach that takes into account the distribution of stars in the Galaxy \cite{2018AJ....156...58B}. As the reddening published along the \G\ DR2 \cite{2018A&A...616A...8A} could be wrong for stars located away from the used set of isochrones, we took the information about the reddening at specific sky locations and distances from the all-sky three-dimensional dust map produced by \citet{2017A&A...606A..65C}. To infer a band dependent extinction, a total to selective extinction ratio ($R$) was used. The values of $R$, considering the extinction law $R_V = 3.1$, were taken from the tabulated results published in \citet{2011ApJ...737..103S}.

To determine the limiting threshold between single and multiple candidates, we first fit a linear representation of the main sequence to the median of the distribution of the absolute magnitudes in the $0.02$~mag wide colour bins. The lower limit for the binaries was placed $0.25$~mag above the fitted line.

Confirmation that the unseen companion could contribute this extra flux also comes from other photometric systems, where the distribution of absolute magnitudes for both groups is shown in Figure \ref{fig:viol_photometry}. On average, multiple candidates are brighter by $\sim$0.55 magnitude in every considered band. For an identical binary system, a measured magnitude excess would be $0.75$, and $1.2$ for a triple system. As the observed difference is not constant in every band, as would be expected for a system composed of identical stars, we expect some differences in parameters between the components of the system. This comparison can be argued under the assumption that all considered photometric measurements were performed at the same time. Of course, that is not exactly true in our case as the acquisition time between different photometric surveys can vary by a few to 10 years. As the Sun-like stars are normal, low activity stars, this effect is most probably negligible, but events like occultations between the stars in the system can still occur.

\section{Single star models}
\label{sec:models_all}
Once the selection of interesting stars was performed, we began with the analysis of their possible multiplicity. Our procedure for the analysis of suspected multiple stellar systems is based on spectroscopic and photometric data-driven single star models that were constructed from observations taken from multiple large sky surveys. With this approach, we exclude assumptions about stellar properties and populations that are usually used to generate synthetic data. In this section, we describe approaches that were used to create those models.

\subsection{Spectroscopic model}
\label{sec:s_model}
Every stellar spectrum can be largely described using four basic physical stellar parameters: \Teff, \Logg, metallicity, and \vsin. To construct a model that would be able to recreate a spectrum corresponding to any conceivable combination of those parameters, we used a data-driven approach named \TC. The model was trained on a set of normalised GALAH spectra that meet the following criteria: the spectrum must not be flagged as peculiar \cite{2017ApJS..228...24T}, have a signal to noise ratio (SNR) per resolution element in the green arm >~20, does not contain any monitored reduction problems and have valid \TC\ stellar parameters. Additionally, we limited our set to main sequence dwarf stars (below the arbitrarily defined line shown in Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon}) as giants are not relevant for our analysis. Additionally, the decision not to consider giants was taken as a result of the fact that accurate modelling of their spectra requires information about their luminosity. It should be noted that the application of these limits does not ensure that our training set is entirely free from spectra of unresolved (or even clearly resolved SB2 binaries), as would be ideally desired.

In order to train the model, all spectra were first shifted to the rest frame by the reduction pipeline \cite{2017MNRAS.464.1259K}, and then linearly interpolated onto a common wavelength grid. The training procedure consists of minimising a loss function between an internal model of \TC\ and observations for every pixel of a spectrum \cite{2015ApJ...808...16N}.

The result of this training procedure are quadratic relations that take desired stellar parameters \Teff, \Logg, \Feh, and \vsin\ to reconstruct a target spectrum. Spectra generated in this manner are trustworthy only within the parameter space defined by the training set, where the main limitation is the effective temperature which ranges from $\sim$4600 to $\sim$6700~K on the main sequence. Spectra of hotter stars are easy to reproduce, but they lack elemental absorption lines that we would like to analyse. On the other hand, spectra of colder stars are packed with molecular absorption lines and therefore harder to reproduce and analyse. The model itself can be used to extrapolate spectra outside the initial training set, but as they can not be verified, they were not considered to be useful for the analysis.

\subsection{Photometric model}
\label{sec:p_model}
With the use of a model that produces normalised spectra for every given set of stellar parameters, we lose all information about the stars' colour, luminosity, and spectral energy distribution. This can be overcome using another model that generates the photometric signature of the star in question. To create this kind of a model, we first collected up to 13 apparent magnitudes from the selected photometric surveys (\G, APASS, 2MASS, and WISE) for every star in the GALAH survey. Whenever possible, these values were converted to absolute magnitudes using the distance to stars inferred by the Bayesian approach \cite{2018AJ....156...58B}. Before using the pre-computed published distances, we removed all sources whose computed RUWE was greater than $1.4$. The magnitudes of every individual star were also corrected for the reddening effect, except for the WISE photometric bands W1 and W2 that were considered to be extinction free as their extinction is more that 10-times smaller than as measured for the V band.

Using the valid \TC\ stellar parameters, the inferred and corrected absolute magnitudes in multiple photometric bands were grouped into bins that contain stars within $\Delta$\Teff~=~$\pm$80~K, $\Delta$\Logg~=~$\pm$0.05~dex, and $\Delta$\Feh~=~$\pm$0.1~dex around the bin centre. As spectroscopically unresolved multiple stellar systems could still be present in this bin, median photometric values are computed per bin to minimise their effect. Extrapolation outside this grid that covers the entire observational stellar parameter space is not desired nor implemented as it may produce erroneous values. When a photometric signature of a star with parameters between the grid points is requested, it is recovered by linear interpolation between the neighbouring grid points. The median photometric signature for the requested stellar parameters could also be computed on-the-fly using the same binning, but we found out that this produced insignificant difference and increased the processing time by more than a factor of two.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{kiel_cannon_contour_iDR3.png}
	\caption{Complete observational set of valid stellar parameters shown as a varied density of grey dots. Contours around the diagram illustrate a coverage of parameter space in different \Feh\ bins.

Additionally, black dashed linear line represents arbitrarily defined limit between giant and dwarf stars that were used in the process of training a spectroscopic single star model.}
	\label{fig:kiel_cannon}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Limitations in the parameter space}
As already emphasized, spectroscopic and photometric models were built on real observations and are therefore limited by the training set coverage. The limitations are visually illustrated by Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon}, where the dashed curve, from which single stars are drawn, is plotted over the observations. This arbitrary quadratic function is defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:logg_teff}
	\log g = 2.576 + 9.48 \cdot 10^{-4} \ T_\mathrm{eff} - 1.10 \cdot 10^{-7} \ T_\mathrm{eff}^2,
\end{equation}
where values of \Teff\ and \Logg\ are given in units of K and \cms\ respectively. The polynomial coefficients were determined by fitting a quadratic function to manually defined points that represent regions with the highest density of stars on the shown Kiel diagram. From Equation \ref{equ:logg_teff}, it follows that the \Logg\ of a selected single star is not varied freely, but computed from the selected \Teff\ whose range is limited within the values 6550~\textgreater~\Teff~\textgreater~4650~K.

Focusing on solar-like stars gives us an advantage in their modelling as the whole observational diagram in Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon} is sufficiently populated with stars of solar-like iron abundance. When going towards more extreme \Feh\ values (high or low), coverage of the main sequence starts to decrease. For cooler stars, this happens at low iron abundance (\Feh~\textless~$-0.3$) and for hot stars at high abundance (\Feh~\textgreater~$0.3$). Those limits pose no problems for our analysis, unless the wrong stellar configuration is used to describe the observations. At that point, the spectroscopic fitting procedure would try to compensate for too deep or too shallow spectral lines (effect of wrongly selected \Teff) by decreasing or increasing \Feh\ beyond values reasonable for solar-like objects. 

\section{Characterization of multiple system candidates}
\label{sec:multi_fit}
For the detailed characterization of solar twin candidates that show excess luminosity, we used their complete available photometric and spectroscopic information. The excess luminosity can only be explained by the presence of an additional stellar component or a star that is hotter or larger than the Sun. Both of those cases can be investigated and confirmed by the data and models described in Sections \ref{sec:data_triples} and \ref{sec:models_all}. In the scope of our comparative methodology, we constructed a broad collection of synthetic single, double, and triple stellar systems that were compared and fitted to the observations.

As the measured \G\ DR2 parallaxes, and therefore inferred distances, of some objects, are poorly fitted or highly uncertain, the distance results provided by \citet{2018AJ....156...58B} yield three distinct distance estimates - the mode of an inferred distance distribution (\texttt{r\_est}) and a near and distant distance (\texttt{r\_lo}, and \texttt{r\_hi}) estimation, between which 68~\% of the distance estimations are distributed. As the actual shape of the distribution is not known and could be highly skewed, we did not draw multiple possible distances from the distribution, but only used its most probable value (mode).

\subsection{Fitting procedure}
A complete characterization and exploration fitting procedure for every stellar configuration (single, binary, and triple system) consist of four consecutive steps that are detailed in the following sections. As we are investigating solar twin spectra, the initial assumption for the iron abundance of the system is set to \Feh~=~$0$. This also includes the assumption that stars in a system are of the same age, at similar evolutionary stages, and were formed from a similarly enriched material. If that is true, we can set iron abundance to be equal for all stars in the system. This notion is supported by the simulations \cite{2019arXiv190210719K} and studies \cite{2019arXiv190402159K} of field stars showing that close stars are very likely to be co-natal if their velocity separation is small.

The observed systems must be composed of multiple main sequence stars. Otherwise, the giant companion would dominate the observables, and the system would not be a spectroscopic match to the Sun. Therefore their parameters \Teff\ and \Logg\ are drawn from the middle of the main sequence determined by \TC\ parameters. The Kiel diagram of the stars with valid parameters and model of the main sequence isochrone used in the fitting procedure are shown in Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon}.

\subsubsection{Photometric fitting - first step}
\label{sec:photo_fit}
With those initial assumptions in mind, we begin with the construction of the photometric signature of the selected stellar configuration. To find the best model that describes the observations, we employ a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting approach \cite{2013PASP..125..306F}, where the varied parameter is the effective temperature of the components. The selected \Teff\ values, and inferred \Logg\ (Equation \ref{equ:logg_teff}), are fed to the photometric model (Section \ref{sec:p_model}) to predict a photometric signature of an individual component. Multiple stellar signatures are combined together into a single unresolved stellar source using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
	M_{model} = -2.5 \log{}_{10} \Big( \sum_{i=1}^{n_s} 10^{-0.4 M_i} \Big); \ n_s=[1, 2, 3],
\end{equation}
where $M_i$ denotes absolute magnitude of a star in one of the used photometric bands, and $n_s$ number of components in a system. The newly constructed photometric signature at selected \Teff\ values is compared to the observations using the photometric log-likelihood function $\ln p_{P}$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:lnp_p}
	\ln p_{P}(T_\mathrm{eff} | M, \sigma) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n_p} \Big[ \frac{(M_i - M_{model, i})^2}{\sigma_i^2} +ln(2\pi\sigma_i^2) \Big],
\end{equation}
where $M$ and $\sigma$ represent extinction corrected absolute magnitudes, and their measured uncertainties that were taken for multiple published catalogues presented in Section \ref{sec:data_triples}. The constructed photometric model of a multiple system is represented by the variable $M_{model}$ and the number of photometric bands by $n_p$. The maximum, and most common value for $n_p$ is 13, but in some cases, it can drop to as low as 8. The MCMC procedure is employed to maximise this log-likelihood and find the best fitting stellar components.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{150408004101169_p1884_init_3_walkers_comb.png}
	\caption{Initial distribution of walker parameters considered in the photometric fit. To ensure unique solutions with increasing \Teff, combinations above the linear line were not considered in the fit. Convergence of walkers in the initial photometric fit. The plot shows a log-probability of the posteriors shown in the Figure \ref{fig:posterior_dist}. Walkers converge to the same value of log-probability after ~50 steps. Every walker is plotted with different colour.}
	\label{fig:teff_initial_walkers}
\end{figure}

To determine the best possible combination of \Teff\ values, we initiate the fit with $1200$ uniformly distributed random combinations of initial temperature values that span the parameter space shown in Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon}. The number of initial combinations is intentionally high in order to sufficiently explore the temperature space. Excessive or repeated variations of initial parameters are rearranged by a prior limitation that the temperatures of components must be decreasing, therefore \Teffn{1}~$\geq$~\Teffn{2}~$\geq$~\Teffn{3} in the case of a triple system (example of used initial walker parameters is shown in Figure \ref{fig:teff_initial_walkers}). The initial conditions are run for 200 steps. The number of steps was selected in such a way to ensure a convergence of all considered cases (example of the walkers convergence is shown in Figure \ref{fig:teff_initial_walkers}). The distribution of priors for such a run is shown as a corner plot in Figure \ref{fig:posterior_dist}. After that, only the best 150 walkers are kept, their values perturbed by 2~\%, and run for another 200 steps to determine the posterior distribution of the parameters varied during the MCMC fit. This two-step run is needed to speed up the process and discard solutions with lower $\ln p_{P}$. During the initial tests, we found that the investigated parameter space can have multiple local minima which attract walkers, especially in the case of a triple system.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{150408004101169_p1884_corner_3star_00.png}
	\caption{Distribution of considered posteriors during the initial MCMC photometric fit for one of the objects that was at the end classified as a triple candidate. As the plots show the first step in the fitting procedure that explores the complete parameter space, the distributions are not expected to be smooth because of possible multiple local minima. Values indicated with blue crosses on the scatter plots represent medians for the 10~\% of the best fitting solutions. Value above the plots represent mean value of the histogram and its difference towards 16$^{th}$ and 84$^{th}$ percentile of the histogram. The same percentiles are also marked on histograms with black dashed lines.}
	\label{fig:posterior_dist}
\end{figure}

After the completion of all MCMC steps, the considered parameter combinations are ordered by their log-likelihood in descending order. Of those, only 10~\% of the best fitting combinations are used to compute final \Teffn{[1-3]}\ values. They are computed as the median of the selected best combinations. 

\subsubsection{Spectroscopic fitting - second step}
\label{sec:spectrum_fit}
After an effective temperature of the components has been determined, we proceed with the evaluation of how well they reproduce the observed spectrum. As a majority of the fitted systems do not consist of multiple components with a \Teff\ equal to solar, the \Feh\ of the system must be slightly changed to equalize absorption strength of the simulated and observed spectral lines.

To determine the \Feh\ of the system, we first compute a simulated spectrum for every component using a spectroscopic model described in Section \ref{sec:s_model}. Individual spectra are afterwards combined using equations
\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:flux12}
	\begin{aligned}  %split can also be used here
	r_{12} &= \frac{L_{2,\lambda}}{L_{1,\lambda}}; \ \lambda=[1, 2, 3, 4]\\ 
	f_{model,\lambda} &= \frac{f_{1,\lambda}}{1+r_{12}} + \frac{f_{2,\lambda}}{1+1/r_{12}}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
in the case of a binary system, or equations
\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:flux123}
	\begin{aligned}
	r_{12} &= \frac{L_{2,\lambda}}{L_{1,\lambda}},\ \ r_{13} = \frac{L_{3,\lambda}}{L_{1,\lambda}}\\ 
	f_{model,\lambda} &= \frac{f_{1,\lambda}}{1 + r_{12} + r_{13}} + \frac{r_{12} f_{2,\lambda}}{1 + r_{12} + r_{13}} + \frac{r_{13} f_{3,\lambda}}{1 + r_{12} + r_{13}}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
in the case of a triple system. 

Individual normalised spectra, denoted by $f_{n,\lambda}$ in Equations \ref{equ:flux12} and \ref{equ:flux123}, are weighted by the luminosity ratios between the components ($r_{xy}$) and then summed together. 

As the HERMES spectrum covers four spectral ranges, whose distribution of spectral energy depends on stellar \Teff, different luminosity ratios also have to be used for every spectral arm. Of all of the used photometric systems, APASS filters B, g', r', and i' have the best spectral match with blue, green, red, and infrared HERMES arm. The modelled APASS magnitudes of the same stars are used to compute luminosity ratios between them.

The described summation of the spectra introduces an additional assumption about the analysed object. With this step, we assume that components have a negligible internal spread of projected radial velocities that could otherwise introduce asymmetries in the shape of observed spectral lines. The assumption allows us to combine individual components without any wavelength corrections.

Similarly, as in the previous case, a Bayesian MCMC fitting procedure was used to maximise the spectroscopic \hbox{log-likelihood} $\ln p_{S}$ defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:lnp_s}
	\ln p_{S}(\mathrm{[Fe/H]} | f, \sigma) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{\lambda}^{} \Big[ \frac{(f_{\lambda} - f_{model, \lambda})^2}{\sigma_{\lambda}^2} +ln(2\pi\sigma_{\lambda}^2) \Big],
\end{equation}
where $f$ and $\sigma$ represent the observed spectrum and its per-pixel uncertainty, respectively. A modelled spectrum of the system, at selected \Feh, is represented by the variable $f_{model}$ and the number of wavelength pixels in that model by $\lambda$. Combined, all four spectral bands consist of almost $16,000$ pixels. \Teff\ values of the components are fixed for all considered cases.

The MCMC fit is initiated with 150 randomly selected \Feh\ values, whose uniform distribution is centred at the initial \Feh\ value of the system and has a span of $0.4$ dex. All of the initiated walkers are run for 100 steps. At every \Feh\ level, a new simulated spectrum composite is generated and compared to the observed spectrum by computing log-likelihood $\ln p_{S}$ of a selected \Feh\ value. The range of possible \Feh\ values considered in the fit is limited by a flat prior between $-0.5$ and $0.4$. 

By the definition of \Feh\ in the scope of GALAH \TC\ analysis, the parameter describes stellar iron abundance and not its metallicity as commonly used in the literature. Therefore only spectral absorption regions of un-blended Fe atomic lines are used to compute the spectral log-likelihood. Having to fit only one variable at a time, the solution is easily found and computed as a median value of all posteriors considered in the fit.

\subsubsection{Final fit - third step}
\label{sec:final_fit}
A changed value of \Feh\ for the system will introduce subtle changes to its photometric signature, therefore we re-initiate the photometric fitting procedure. It is equivalent to the procedure described in Section \ref{sec:spectrum_fit}, but with much narrower initial conditions. These new initial conditions are uniformly drawn from the distribution centred at \Teff\ values determined in the first step of the fitting procedure. The width of the uniform distribution is equal to 100~K. Drawn initial conditions are afterwards run through the same procedure as described before.

At this point, the second and third step in the fitting procedure can be repeatedly run several times to further pinpoint the best solution. We found out that further refinement was not needed in our case as it did not influence the determined number of stars in the system.


\subsection{Number of stellar components - final classification}
\label{sec:number_stars_tripple}
The fitting procedure described above was used to evaluate observations of every multiple stellar candidate to determine whether they belong to a single, binary or triple stellar system. This resulted in the following set of results for every configuration: predicted \Teff\ of the components, \Feh\ of the system, simulated spectrum, and simulated absolute magnitudes.

As the photometric and spectroscopic fits do not always agree on the best configuration, the following set of steps and rules was applied to classify results in one of six classes presented in Table \ref{tab:res_multiples}.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Number of different systems discovered by the fitting procedure performed on possible multiple stars that exhibit excess luminosity. A sign $\geq$ indicates that both fits did not point to the same configuration. The number is taken from the fit will indication of system with less components.}
	\begin{tabular}{c c}
		\hline
		Configuration classification & Number of systems \\ 
		\hline \hline
		1 star & 2 \\
		$\geq$ 1 star & 14 \\
		2 stars & 27 \\
		$\geq$ 2 stars & 14 \\
		3 stars & 6 \\
		Inconclusive & 1 \\
		\hline
		Total objects & 64 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tab:res_multiples}
\end{table}


\begin{itemize}
	\item Compute $\chi^2$ between the simulated photometric signature of the modelled system and extinction corrected absolute photometric observations for every considered stellar configuration. 
	\item Compute $\chi^2$ between the simulated spectrum of the modelled system and the complete GALAH observed spectrum for every considered stellar configuration. 
	\item Independently select the best fitting configuration with the lowest $\chi^2$ for photometric and spectroscopic fit.
	\item If the best photometric and spectroscopic fit point to the same configuration, then the system is classified as having a number of stars defined by both fitting procedures.
	\item If the best photometric and spectroscopic fit do not point to the same configuration, then the system is classified as having at least as many stars as determined by the prediction with a lower number of stars (e.g. $\geq$~2 stars).
	\item If the difference between those two predictions is greater than 1 (e.g. photometric fit points to a single star and spectroscopic to a triple star), then the system is classified as inconclusive. 
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}


The classification produced using these rules is shown as colour coded \G\ colour-magnitude diagram in Figure \ref{fig:gabs_binmulti}.

\subsection{Quality flags}
\label{sec:quaflags}
In additional to our final classification, we also provide an additional quality checks that might help to identify cases for which our method might return questionable stellar configuration. All such checks, listed in Table \ref{tab:q_flag}, are represented by bits of a parameter \texttt{flag} in the final published table (Table \ref{tab:out_table_triple}). The first bit gives an indication of whether the object could have an uncertain \G\ astrometric solution, whereas the second and the third bits indicate if the final fitted solution has a worse match with the observations than the parameters produced by the \TC\ pipeline. To evaluate this, we used the original stellar parameters reported for the object to construct their photometric and spectroscopic synthetic model that was compared to the observations by computing their $\chi^2$ similarity (\texttt{m\_sim\_p} and \texttt{m\_sim\_f} in Table \ref{tab:out_table_triple}). The resulting fitted spectrum or photometric signature is marked as deviating if its similarity towards observations is worse than for the reported one star parameters. This might not be the best indication of possible mismatch as \TC\ parameters of analysed multiple candidates often deviate from the main sequence in the Kiel diagram (Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon}) and therefore fall into less populated parameter space, where they can skew the single star models (Sections \ref{sec:s_model} and \ref{sec:p_model}).

	\caption{Explanation of the used binary quality flags in the final classification of the stellar configuration.

Once we concluded our analysis of the set of 64 objects that showed obvious signs of excess luminosity, we then proceeded to study the remaining 265 objects that are most probably not part of a complex stellar system. To explore their composition, they were analysed with the same procedure as multiple candidates (Section \ref{sec:multi_fit}). Before running the procedure, we omitted the option to fit for a triple system as they clearly do not possess enough excess luminosity for that kind of a system.

The obtained results were analysed and classified using the same set of rules introduced in Section \ref{sec:number_stars_tripple}. Retrieved classes are summarized in Table \ref{tab:res_single} and in Figure \ref{fig:gabs_binmulti}. In the latter we see that the potential binaries are located on the top of the colour-magnitude diagram, which is consistent with the potential presence of an additional stellar source.

\section{Orbital period constraints}
\label{sec:orital_periods}
The gathered radial velocity observations of possible multiple systems point to configurations that change slowly as a function of time. Using the observational constraints and models that describe the formation of the observed spectra, we try to set limiting values on the orbital parameters of the detected triple stellar system candidates. In order to have a greater sample size, we use both definite (class 3) and probable (class $\geq$2) triple stars.

With the limited set of observations, we have to set assumptions about the constitution of those systems. For a hierarchical 2~+~1 system to be dynamically stable on long timescales, its ratio between the orbital period of an inner pair $P_S$ and outer pair $P_L$ must be above a certain limit. \citet{2006epbm.book.....E} showed that $P_L$/$P_S$ must be higher than 5. The same lower limit is noticeable when the correlation between periods of the known triple stars is plotted \cite{2008MNRAS.389..925T, 2018ApJS..235....6T}.

In order to estimate the periods, we have to know the masses and distances between the stars in a system. Without complete information about the projected velocity variation in a system, masses can also be inferred from the spectral type. As we are looking at the solar twin triples, whose effective temperatures are all very similar and close to solar values (see Figure \ref{fig:triple_params}), a conclusion is that all stars also have a solar-like mass $\sim$M$_{\odot}$. From this, we can set the inner mass ratio $q_S$ to be close to $1$ and the outer mass ratio $q_L \sim 0.5$. When we are dealing with the outermost star, the inner pair is combined into one object with twice the mass of the Sun. The likelihood of such a configuration is also supported by the observations \cite{2008MNRAS.389..925T} where a higher concentration of triple systems is present around those mass ratios. Contrary to our systems, twin binaries with equal masses usually have shorter orbital periods \cite{2000A&A...360..997T}. 

With the initial assumption about the configuration of the triple systems and masses of the stars, the periods of the inner and outer pair can be constrained to some degree as other orbital elements (inclination, ellipticity, phase \ldots) are not known.

\subsection{Outer pair and \G\ angular resolution}
\label{sec:orbits_gaia}
Limited by its design, \G\ spacecraft and its on-ground data processing are in theory unable to resolve stars with the angular separation below $\sim0.1$~arcsec. Above that limit, their separability is governed by the flux ratio of the pair. The validation report of the latest data release \cite{2018A&A...616A..17A} shows that the currently achieved angular resolution is approximately $0.4$~arcsec as none of the source pairs is found closer than this separation. We used this reported angular limit to assess possible orbital configurations that are consistent with both the spectroscopic and astrometric observations.

Along with the final astrometric parameters, the \G\ data set also contains information about the goodness of the astrometric fit. \citet{2018RNAAS...2b..20E} used those parameters to confirm old and find new candidates for unresolved exoplanet hosting binaries in the data set. As we are looking at a system of multiple stars that orbit around their common centre of mass, we expect their photo-centre to slightly shift during such orbital motion. The observed wobble of the photo-centre also depends on the mass of stars in the observed system. In the case of a binary system containing two identical stars, the wobble would not be observed, but its prominence increase as the difference between their luminosities becomes more pronounced. This subtle change in the position of a photo-centre adds additional stellar movement to the astrometric fit, consequently degrading its quality. Improvements for such a motion will be added in later \G\ data releases. If a system has an orbital period much longer than the time-span of \G\ DR2 measurements (22 months), its movement has not yet affected the astrometric solution. This puts an upper limit on an orbital period as it should not be longer than few years in order to already affect the astrometric fit results. 

Setting arbitrary limits to the published parameters of the astrometric fit quality (\texttt{astrometric\_excess\_noise}~>~5, and \texttt{astrometric\_gof\_al}~>~20 as proposed by \citet{2018RNAAS...2b..20E}), none of our 329 stars meets those requirements. This suggests that all of them are most likely well below the \G\ separability limit and/or have long orbital periods. Another indicator for a lower-quality astrometric fit that we can use is RUWE. Figure \ref{fig:gabs_colour} shows distribution of potentially problematic large RUWE among single and multiple candidates. The latter, on average, have a much poorer fit quality that might indicate a presence of an additional parameter that needs to be considered in the astrometric fit. 

Distances to triple stars, shown by the histogram in Figure \ref{fig:gaia_dist} range from around $0.3$ to $0.9$~kpc. From this we can assume the maximal allowable distance between components of an outer pair to be in the order of $100-350$~AU, pointing to outer orbital periods larger than $500$~years. To test if such systems would meet our detection constraints, we created 100,000 synthetic binary systems whose orbital parameters were uniformly distributed within the parameter ranges given in Table \ref{tab:mc_gaia}. Observable radial velocities of both components were computed using the following equations:

\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:rad_vel1}
	v_{1} = \frac{2 \pi \sin i}{P \sqrt{1 - e^2}} \frac{a q}{1+q} \Big(\cos(\theta + \omega) + e \cos \omega \Big),
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:rad_vel2}
	v_{2} = \frac{2 \pi a \sin i}{P \sqrt{1 - e^2}} \frac{a}{1+q} \Big(\cos(\theta + \omega + \pi) + e \cos (\omega  + \pi) \Big),\:\mathrm{and}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{equ:rad_period}
	P = \sqrt{a^3 \frac{4 \pi^2}{G M_1 (1 + q)}}.
\end{equation}

The parameters in the above equations represent the following physical description of a binary orbit: $i$ - inclination, $a$ - length of a semi-major axis, $q$ - mass ratio between the stars, $e$ - eccentricity of the elliptical orbit, $P$ - orbital period, $\theta$ - true anomaly of an orbit, and $\omega$ - argument of the closest separation in orbit.

The distribution of velocity separations ($\Delta v = v_2 - v_1$) for synthetic systems is given by Figure \ref{fig:mc_rv_sep}, where we can see that more than $99.7$~\% of generated configurations would produce a spectrum that would still be considered as a solar twin ($\Delta v$~<~6~\kms, see Section \ref{sec:rv_sep_sim} and Figure \ref{fig:rv_similarity} for further clarification). If we set the semi-major axis $a$ (in Table \ref{tab:mc_gaia}) to single value in the same simulation, we can find the closest separation that would still meet the same observational criteria in at least $68$~\% of the cases. In our simulation this happens at the mutual separation of $10$~AU (and at $50$~AU for $95$~\% of the cases). The orbital period of a such outer pair is about $18$~years (and $200$~years for $50$~AU) and is most probably way too long to had significant effect on the quality of the astrometric fit. Considering observationally favorable orbital configurations with face-on orbits, the actual system could be much more compact than estimated.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Ranges of the orbital parameters used for the prediction of observable radial velocity separation between stars in an outer binary pair. The range of the semi-major axis length $a$ is set between the \G\ separability limit for the closest and farthest triple candidate. The uniform distribution of $a$ is a good approximation of the real periodicity distribution published by \citet{2010ApJS..190....1R} as we are sampling a narrow range of it. Use of the real observed distribution would in our case introduce insignificant changes in radial velocity separation as we are simulating wide, slowly rotating systems.}

\subsection{Inner binary pair and formation of double lines in a spectrum}
\label{sec:orbits_sb2}
An upper estimate of orbital sizes for an outer pair gives us a confirmation that almost every considered random orbital configurations would satisfy the observational and selection constraints. To ensure the long-term stability of such a system, the inner pair must have a period that is at least five times shorter \cite{2006epbm.book.....E}. At such short orbital periods, the inner stars could potentially move sufficiently rapidly in their orbits as to produce noticeable absorption line splitting for edge-on orbits. To be confident that none of the analysed objects produces such an SB2 spectrum, we visually checked all considered spectra and found no noticeable line splitting in any of the acquired GALAH or Asiago spectra. A subtle hint about a possible broadening of the spectral lines comes from the determined \vsin. The median of its distribution in Figure \ref{fig:vsini_hist} is higher for multiple candidates with the excess projected velocity of $\sim$0.5~\kms.

Accounting for the GALAH resolving power and spectral sampling, we can estimate a minimal radial velocity separation between components of a spectrum to show clear visual signs of duplicated spectral lines. To determine a lower limit, we combined two solar spectra of different flux ratios and visually evaluated when the line splitting becomes easily noticeable. With equally bright sources, this happens at the separation of $\sim$14~\kms. When the secondary component contributes 1/3 of the total flux, minimal separation is increased to $\sim$20~\kms. A similar separation is needed when secondary contributes only 10~\% of the flux. As no line splitting is observed in our analysed spectra, we can be confident that the velocity separation between the binary components was lower than that during the acquisition.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{hist_Vsini_cannon_ebv_c3_07.png}
	\caption{Distribution of determined \vsin\ for analysed single and multiple candidates. Median values of the distributions are marked with dashed vertical lines.}
	\label{fig:vsini_hist}
\end{figure}

Considering the minimal ratio between outer and inner binary period, we can deduce an expected radial velocity separation of an inner pair for the widest possible orbits. As explained in previous section, we used Equations \ref{equ:rad_vel1}-\ref{equ:rad_period} and possible ranges of inner orbital parameters (Table \ref{tab:mc_gaia_inner}) to generate a set of synthetic binary systems. The distribution of their $\Delta v$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mc_rv_sep_inner} and represent inner binaries with orbital periods from $100$ to $700$~years. At those orbital periods, more than $92$~\% of the considered configurations would satisfy the condition of $\Delta v$~<~4~\kms, ensuring that the observed composite of two equal solar spectra would still be considered as a solar twin (see Section \ref{sec:rv_sep_sim} and Figure \ref{fig:rv_similarity} for further clarification). If we limit our synthetic inner binaries to only one orbital period, we can estimate the most compact system that would still meet the observational criteria in at least $68$~\% of the cases. Those criteria are satisfied at the orbital period of $40$~years with a semi-major axis of $14$~AU.

\subsection{Multi-epoch radial velocities}
\label{sec:orbits_rv}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{asiago_ref_comp.pdf}
	\label{fig:asiago_spectrum_twin}
	\caption{Follow up observation of the star TYC 502-985-1.

Labels on the left side give wavelength ranges (in \AA) of the individual panel. To generate this plot, shown subsets of both spectra were renormalised with a linear function and the same sigma clipping levels. Combination of different barycentric and radial velocity is evident in the bottom infra-red panel, where the absorption feature of Earth atmosphere is dominant and shifted in respect to the observations.}
\end{figure}

To support our claims about slowly changing low orbital speeds in detected triple candidates, we analysed changes in their measured radial velocities between the GALAH and other comparable all-sky surveys. Distributions of changes are presented by three histograms in Figure \ref{fig:rv_survey}. There almost all velocity changes, except one, are within 5~\kms. Differences between the GALAH and \G\ radial velocities were expected to be small as the latter reports median velocities in the time-frame that is similar to the acquisition span of the GALAH spectra. Extending the GALAH observations in the past with RAVE DR5 \cite{2017AJ....153...75K} and in the future with Asiago observations did not produce any extreme changes. For this comparison, we also have to consider the uncertainty of the measurements. They are in the order of $\sim$2~\kms\ for RAVE and $\sim$1~\kms\ for Asiago spectra. Example of the spectrum acquired for one of the best solar twins is presented and compared towards the real solar spectrum in Figure \ref{fig:asiago_spectrum_twin}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{guess_all_rv_diff.png}

Blue histograms represent velocity difference for all investigated multiple candidates and orange histograms for discovered triple systems only.}
	\label{fig:rv_survey}
\end{figure}

With the data synergies of those three surveys, we could produce only three observational time-series that have observations at more than two sufficiently separated epochs. With only three data points in each graph, not much can be said about actual orbits, especially if their temporal variability is much shorter that time between different observations.

\section{Simulations and tests of different configurations}
\label{sec:simulations}
To determine the limitations of the employed algorithms, we used them to evaluate a set of synthetic photometric and spectroscopic sources. As the complete procedure depends on the criteria for the selection of solar twin candidates, we first investigated if the selection criteria allows for any broadening of the spectral lines or their multiplicity as they are both signs of a multiple system with components at different radial velocities.

In the second part, we generated a set of ideal synthetic systems that were analysed by the same fitting procedure as the observed data set. The results of this analysis are used to determine what kind of systems could be recognized with the fitting procedure and how the results could be used to spot suspicious combinations of fitted parameters. 

In the final part, we try to evaluate selection biases that might arise from the position of analysed stars on the \G\ colour-magnitude diagram and from the GALAH selection function that picks objects based on their apparent magnitude.

\subsection{Radial velocity separation between components}
\label{sec:rv_sep_sim}
To determine the minimal detectable radial velocity (RV) separation between components in a binary or a triple system, we constructed a synthetic spectrum resembling an observation of multiple Suns at a selected RV separation. The spectrum of a primary component was fixed at the rest wavelength with $RV = 0$~\kms\, and the secondary spectrum shifted to a selected velocity. After the shift, these two spectra were added together based on their assumed flux ratio. 

The generated synthetic spectrum was compared to the solar spectrum with exactly the same metric as described in Section \ref{sec:spec_comp_twins}. Computed spectral similarities at different separations were compared to the similarities of analysed solar twin candidates. The first RV separation that produces a spectrum that is more degraded than the majority of solar twin candidates was determined to be a minimal RV at which the observed spectrum would be degraded enough that it would no longer be recognised as a solar twin. The high SNR of the generated spectrum was not taken into account for this analysis in contrast to the algorithm that was used to pinpoint solar twin candidates. Therefore we also omitted candidates with a lower similarity that in our case directly corresponds to their low SNR. 

The result of this comparison is presented in the left side of Figure \ref{fig:rv_similarity}, where we can see that the minimal detectable separation of two equally bright stars resembling the Sun is $\sim$4~\kms. In the case where a primary star contributes $2/3$ of the total flux, the minimal RV increases to $\sim$6~\kms\ (see right side of Figure \ref{fig:rv_similarity}). Further increase in the ratio between their fluxes would also increase a minimal detectable separation, but only to a certain threshold from where on a secondary star would not contribute enough flux for it to be detectable, and its received flux would be comparable to the typical HERMES spectral noise. In our case, this happens when the secondary contributes less than 10~\% of the total flux. These boundaries are only indicative as they also heavily depend on the quality of the acquired spectra. When a low level of noise with the Gaussian distribution ($\sigma = 0.01$) is added to the second component with a comparable luminosity, the minimal RV decreases because the similarity between spectra also decreases. In that case, the similarity for $\Delta v = 0$ is located near the mode value of similarity distribution in Figure \ref{fig:rv_similarity}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sinlg_multi_sim_b3_50_50_comb.png}
	\caption{Histograms of the Canberra similarities towards solar spectrum for multiple stellar candidates (orange histogram) and single star candidates (green histogram) in the red HERMES arm. Vertical dashed lines in the left plot represent the same similarity measure, but for a binary system comprising of two equally bright Suns, whose components are at different radial velocities. The separation between components is increasing in 2~\kms\ steps, where the leftmost vertical line represents the case where both stars are moving with the same projected velocity. The selected maximal velocity at which the composite spectrum would still be considered a solar twin is marked with the thicker red vertical line. The right plot shows the same data, but for the case of a triple system where only one component out of three has a radial velocity shift in comparison to other two. Distribution of histograms also shows that spectra of multiple system candidates are as (dis)similar as spectra of single stars.}
	\label{fig:rv_similarity}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Analysis of synthetic multiple systems}
The limitations and borderline cases of the fitting procedure were tested by evaluating its performance on a set of synthetic binary and triple systems that were generated using the same models and equations as described in the fitting procedure. An ideal, virtually noiseless set comprised 95 binary and 445 triple systems whose components differ in temperature steps of 100~K. The hottest component in the system was set to values in the range between 5300 and 6200~K. The \Teff\ of the coldest component could go as low as 4800~K. The \Feh\ of all synthetic systems was set to $0.0$ to mimic solar-like conditions. Condensed results are presented in Figures \ref{fig:triple_sym_res}.

As expected, the fitting procedure (Section \ref{sec:multi_fit}) did not have any problem determining the correct configuration of the synthesized system. Temperatures of the components were also correctly recovered with a median error of $0 \pm 13$~K for the hottest component and  $0 \pm 43$~K for the coldest component in a triple system. A more detailed analysis with the distribution of prediction errors, where the temperature difference between components is taken into account, is presented in Figure \ref{fig:triple_sym_res}. From that analysis, we can deduce that \Teff\ of the secondary component is successfully retrieved if it does not deviate by more than 1000~K from the primary. Results at such large temperature difference are inconclusive as the number of simulated systems drops rapidly. The same can be said for the tertiary component, but with the limitation that it should not be colder by more than $700$~K when compared to the secondary star. Beyond that point, the uncertainty of the fitted result increases and a star is determined to be hotter as it is.

Another application of such an analysis is to identify signs that could point to a possibly faulty solution when it is comparably likely that a multiple system is comprised of two or three components. The results of such an analysis are presented in the right part of Figure \ref{fig:triple_sym_res}, where we tried to describe a binary system with a triple system fit. From the distribution of errors, we can observe that the effective temperature of a primary star with the largest flux is recovered with the smallest fit errors whose median is $20 \pm 93$~K. As we are using too many components in that fit, \Teff\ of a secondary is reduced in order to account for the redundant tertiary component in the fit. As imposed by the limit in the fitting procedure, the tertiary \Teffn{3} is set to as low as possible. If the same thing happens for a real observed system, this could be interpreted as a model over-fitting.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{three_stars_fit_sim_res_comb.png}
	\caption{The accuracy of our analysis when the fitting procedure was applied to a synthetic triple system (left column) and synthetic binary sistem (right column). Upper panels show the distribution of \Teff\ prediction errors for a secondary star depending on the difference between selected temperatures of a primary and a secondary star. The lower panel shows the same relation but for a tertiary star in comparison to a secondary. As a reference, the prediction error of a primary star is shown on the left side of both panels. A strange wavy pattern in graphs is a consequence of a low number of sample points. Labels \Teffn{1}, \Teffn{2}, and \Teffn{3} indicate decreasing effective temperatures of stars in a simulated system. In the case when we try to describe a synthetic binary system using the triple star model, reference \Teffn{3} was set to $0$~K. Therefore all results for the tertiary component try to choose a star with the temperature as low as possible, but it can not go lower as model limitation of $4700$~K.}
	\label{fig:triple_sym_res}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Triple stars across the H-R diagram}
In the current stage of Galactic evolution, binary stars with a solar-like \Teff\ are located near a region that is also occupied by main sequence turnoff stars in the Kiel and colour-magnitude diagram (Figures \ref{fig:kiel_cannon} and \ref{fig:gabs_binmulti}). This, combined with the fact that older stars with a comparable initial mass and metallicity would also pass a region occupied with binaries (Figure \ref{fig:gabs_colour}) poses an additional challenge for detection of unresolved multiples if their spectrum does not change sufficiently during the evolution.

To analyse the possible influence of the turnoff stars and older, more evolved stars, we ran the same detection procedure as described in Section \ref{sec:05_selection} and analysis (Section \ref{sec:multi_fit}) to determine the fraction of binaries and triples at different \Teff, ranging from 5100 to 6000~K, with a step of 100~K. A comparison median spectrum was computed from all spectra in the range $\Delta$\Teff~$\pm$~60~K, $\Delta$\Logg~$\pm$~0.05~dex and $\Delta$\Feh~$\pm $~$0.05$~dex, where the main sequence \Logg\ was taken from the main sequence curve shown in Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon}, and \Feh\ was set to $0.0$. The limiting threshold for multiple candidates was automatically determined in the same way as for solar twin candidates (Section \ref{sec:multi_cand}).

Condensed results of the analysis are shown in Figure \ref{fig:triple_hr}, where we can see that both the fraction of stars with excessive luminosity and triple candidates starts increasing above the \Teff~$\sim$~5600~K. This probability increase might indicate that the underlying distribution of more evolved and/or hotter stars might have some effect on our selection function. On the other hand, this increasing binarity fraction coincides with other surveys that show similar trends \cite{2013ARA&A..51..269D}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{teff_triple_dist.png}
	\caption{The upper panel shows the percentage of objects at different positions on the Kiel diagram shown in Figure \ref{fig:kiel_cannon} that show excessive luminosity and are spectroscopically similar to main sequence stars. Similarly, the lower panel shows upper and lower boundary on a percentage of triple system candidates at the same positions. For a definitive candidate, both fits must agree on a triple configuration. The strong dashed vertical line repents a point on Kiel diagram where the main sequence visually starts merging with the red-giant branch, the point where a region above the main sequence becomes polluted with more evolved stars.}
	\label{fig:triple_hr}
\end{figure}

As the detected triple star candidates encompass a fairly small region in a colour-magnitude space, we were interested in the degree to which our analysed spectra are similar to those of other stars in the same region. For this purpose, the GALAH objects with absolute \G\ corrected magnitudes in the range $3.3$~<~M$_{G}$~<~$3.6$ and $0.77$~<~G$_{BP}$-G$_{RP}$~<~$0.84$ were selected and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:tsne_marked}, where spectra are arranged according to their similarity. In this 2D projection (details about the construction of which are given in \citet{2017ApJS..228...24T} and \citet{buder2018}) it is obvious that spectra considered in this chapter clearly exhibit a far greater degree of mutual similarity than other spectra with similar photometric signature. As expected, many of them lie inside the region of SB2 spectra. All of our solar twin candidates were visually checked for the presence of a resolvable binary component. Nevertheless, this plot gives us additional proof of their absence as none of the analysed twins is located inside that region.

Each grey dot represent one spectrum of GALAH survey. Green coloured dots represent objects considered in this chapter, of which objects marked with red were analysed for higher order multiplicity. Yellowish dots represent objects whose \G\ magnitudes fall inside the range of determined triple star candidates.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Observational bias - Galaxia model}
\label{sec:bias}
Every magnitude limited survey, such as the GALAH, will introduce observational bias into the frequency of observed binary stars as their additional flux changes the volume of the Galaxy from where they are sampled. Their distances and occupied volume of space is located further from the Sun and therefore also more spacious than for comparable single stars with the same apparent magnitude and colour.

To evaluate this bias for our type of analysed stars, we created a synthetic Milky Way population of single stars using the Galaxia code \cite{2011ApJ...730....3S}. First, the code was run to create the entire population of stars in the apparent V magnitude range between 10 and 16 without any colour cuts. In order for the distribution of synthesised stars to mimic the GALAH survey as closely as possible, only stars located inside the observed GALAH $2^\circ$ fields were retained. After the spatial filtering, only stars with Sun-like absolute magnitude $M_V~=~4.81$~$\pm$~$0.05$ and colour index $B-V$~=~$0.63$~$\pm$~$0.05$ were kept in the set (reference magnitudes were taken from \citet{2018ApJS..236...47W}).

From the filtered synthetic data set we took three different sub-sets representing a pool of observable single solar twins ($12.0$~$\leq$~V~$\leq$~$14.0$), binary twins ($12.75$~$\leq$~V~$\leq$~$14.75$), and triple twins ($13.2$~$\leq$~V~$\leq$~$15.2$) based on their apparent V magnitudes. Extinction and reddening were not used in this selection as their use did not significantly alter the relationship between the number of stars in sub-sets. Assuming that the frequency of multiple stars is constant and does not change in any of those sets, we can estimate the selection bias on the frequency of multiple stars. The number of stars in each sub-set was 15862, 35470, and 54567 respectively. According to those star counts, the derived frequency of binaries would be too high by a factor of $2.2$ and a factor $3.4$ for triple stars. Considering those factors, the fraction of unresolved triple candidates with solar-like spectra is $\sim$2~\% and $\sim$11~\% for binary candidates. 

Accidental visual binaries that lie along the same line-of-sight and have angular separation smaller that the field-of-view of the 2dF spectroscopic fibre ($2 \arcsec$) or smaller than the \G\ end-of-mission angular resolution ($0.1 \arcsec$) were not considered in this estimation.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}
Combining multiple photometric systems with spectroscopic data from the GALAH and astrometric measurements taken by \G, we showed a possible existence of triple stellar systems with long orbital periods whose combined spectrum mimics solar spectrum. The average composition of such a system consists of three almost identical stars, where one of the stars is $\sim10$~K warmer than the Sun. The coldest has an effective temperature of $\sim120$~K below the Sun. The derived percentage of such unresolved systems would be different for nearby/close stars as they become more/less spatially resolved. In the scope of our magnitude limited survey, we sampled only a fraction of possible distances to multiple systems. Different fractions of binaries might be found for systems closer or farther away from the Sun.

Without any obvious signs of the orbital periodicity in the measured radial velocities of the systems, orbital periods were loosely constrained based on the observational limits and few assumptions. By the prior assumption that the \G\ spacecraft sees those systems as a single light source, we showed that they could be described by orbital periods where a difference between projected velocities of components does not sufficiently degrade an observed spectrum. The spectroscopic signature and radial velocity variations were further used to put a limit on the minimum orbital period of an inner pair to be at least 20~years. Shorter periods are not completely excluded as it could happen that the spectrum was acquired in a specific orbital phase where the difference between projected orbital speeds is negligible. From the fact that analysed objects are spatially unresolvable for the \G\ spacecraft, the orbital size of outer binary pair can extend up to 100 -- 350~AU and therefore have orbital periods of the order of a few hundred years.

To confirm their existence, detected systems are ideal candidates to be observed with precise interferometric measurements or high time-resolution photometers if they happen to be occulted by the Moon. Simulation of the lunar motion showed that four of the analysed multiple candidates lie in its path if the observations are to be carried out from the Asiago observatory that has suitable photon-counting detectors.

The main drawback of the analysis was found to be its separate treatment of photometric and spectroscopic information in two independent fitting procedures. In future analyses, they should be combined to acquire even more precise results as different stellar physical parameters have a different degree of impact on these two types of measurements.

\section{Table description and summary}
